This repo contains files for my FA22 ERHS 535 final project. `FinalProject.Rmd` contains all the code used to produce the flexdashboard. `FinalProject.html` is the final rendered flexdashboard. The flexdashboard consists of three tabs: "Figures", "Tables", and "Tree". "Figures" contains interactive figures rendered using `plotly`. "Tables" contains interactive tables produced using `DT`. "Tree" contains an interactive hierarchical tree generated using `collapsibleTree`.

Information about the data source for this project, as well as guidance for interacting with the flexdashboard, is available in the "README" section in the lower right-hand corner of the "Figures" tab. Additional information is available in the sidebars of the "Tables" and "Tree" tabs.
